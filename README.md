# Welcome to my blog!

This Blog was created to chronical my first month or so at DevAcademy where all the work took place remotely.

It was the first application I ever built and one I am really proud of as at the time it seemed like an impossibly big wall to climb but once done it was supremly satisfying to stand back and look at.

It is an entirely HTML application but has been built to be responisve and presnets beautifuly regardless of what device it is viewed on.
