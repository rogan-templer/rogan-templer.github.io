          Neuroplasticity is based around the belief that the brain can be
          moulded over time and indeed even new skills be learnt.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          Previously it was believed that individuals were unable to learn new
          skills and grow parts of their brain and that a skill was something a
          person was ‘born with’. However, studies in this filed has shown that
          this is not the case and that with effort and training an individual
          can develop parts of their brain and learn new skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          As one can imagine this comes with a number of benefits such as:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>The ability to learn new skills</li>
          <li>Enhance exisiting cognitive capabilities</li>
          <li>Improve brain fitness</li>
          <li>
            If a person has suffered a stroke or other significant brain injury
            they will be able to recover from this to a degree
          </li>

          How can I engage with and use it to benefit myself.

          It is refreshing to hear that all is not lost when it comes to turning
          ones hand to learning a new skill. Given that I am in the middle of
          trying to change careers into a pathway I have never been down before
          it is good to know that the parts of my brain that will help with this
          can be worked on and developed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          From research there are a number of activities one can engage in to
          enhance neuroplasticity (which I will discuss later) which are all
          attainable and not anything out of the ordinary and I can incorporate
          into my day.

          There are a number of different ways you can increase your
          neuroplasticity - these are a few that i thought were relevant to me
          and my situation:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Reading - especially fiction books</li>
          <li>Creating art and other creative pursuits</li>
          <li>Being active.</li>

        <p class="col">
          Growth mindset believes that everyones basic qualities are things that
          can be cultivated, that our talents and aptitudes, interests and
          temperaments can change and grow through our experiences and
          application.

        <br />
        <p class="col">
          This is important when it comes to learning or changing a career path
          (as I am doing here) as it means that I am not pre-determined to a
          specific route and that new disciplines, such as coding asn web
          development, are beyond my reach.

        <p class="col">
          Through out the course of this research it has become apparent that
          there are a number of ways I can introduce the growth mindset into my
          learning journey to help enhance it. In no particular order these are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <ol class="col">
        <li>
          Embrace challenges, there will be many but they should not be seen as
          insurmountable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Persist even in the event of setback, as above I should not let speed
          bumps hold me back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn from any criticism - try not and take criticism as a personal
          slight, rather as an opportunity to learn and grow, perhaps even see
          things in a different light.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy the success of others and see what has helped them and if it can
          apply to me.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p class="col">
        I believe by keeping the above mentioned points foremost in the mind
        will help push me along this learning journey and achieve my goals.
