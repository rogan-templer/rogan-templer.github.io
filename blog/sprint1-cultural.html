            <p class="col">
              The first job i ever had was back in Zimbabwe were I worked for a
              company that run Hunting Safaris. I can already hear everyones
              sharp intake of breath in rage building. I have always loved the
              outdoors and initially i wanted to train to become a professional
              safari guide. I found it difficult to get apprentice guide roles,
              however part of the assessment involves working with dangerous
              game so I took a role with this company. Now from the outset i
              have always had very mixed feeling about sport/trophy hunting but
              I know that with many things in life there are very rarely black
              and white situations in the world and we tend to inhabit a whole
              gamut of shades of grey so I wanted to see this industry for
              myself and make my own mind up.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="col">
              Now having been in the thick of it as it were I still hold some
              strong reservations with regards to aspects of the industry. I
              have, however, also come to understand and even appreciate the
              significant role the industry plays in conservation and the
              protection of vast areas of wild Africa that I so dearly love. I
              also see how important it can be as well in managing conflict
              between wildlife and the local communities that live side by side
              with these wild animals.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="col">
              I could go on for a while here but won’t as i know it is a very
              emotive topic. Suffice to say I see the ethical dilemma posed by
              the industry, but importantly I also understand how vital it is to
              preserving wild areas and helping impoverished local communities
              to benefit form co-existing with these animals rather than
              engaging in conflict with them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="col">
              By becoming involved I was able to gain deeper insight and
              understand into a topic that draws strong opinion from both camps.
              I was able to form my own nuanced views and be at peace with where
              I stand in them. I think in a world that moves at such a rapid
              place we can lose sight about how important it is to take the time
              to look into something before deciding there are only two sides.

          <p class="col">
            I come from a big family so as a result it has had a fir bit of
            input on my values and identity. Being a big family it was important
            to compromise and work together to get things done. I think this has
            then transferred into my work and professional life. I work well in
            a team environment and think that giving everyone a voice is very
            important in the pursuit of success.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            A big family has also input into my identity - To get noticed you
            need to speak up in an environment like that so I think it has
            contributed to me being quite extroverted. I think Africa is also a
            place that encourages these traits - It’s a big, loud and vibrant
            place and i think that has all fed into who I am.

          <h3 class="col s-2">Strengths</h3>
          <p class="col">
            I am quite a process driven person so if I have a set of directions
            or a task outline I am able to follow that well and can then got one
            by myself well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            I do have a knack of picking up new processes and systems quickly
            and with repetition i can feel comfortable relatively quickly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            I do work well in a team environment and I like to ask questions and
            understand why things are happening the way the are or why a
            specific route/method is being used.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3 class="col s-2">Limitations</h3>
          <p class="col">
            As I alluded to above I am quite process driven and this comes at
            the cost of thinking outside the box sometimes, in my hobbies I am
            quite creative and I need to bring that over to my work more as it
            will help when I hit roadblocks in work.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            I do often doubt my abilities and knowledge and like to seek
            constant reassurance that what I am doing is intact right. It is
            good that I recognise this however I do need to work on backing
            myself and believing in my own abilities.
