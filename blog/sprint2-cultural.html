          This has not changed from the first draft of this plan but I suspect
          as we go further down the bootcamp wormhole this section may change
          significantly.

          What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p class="col">
          I think my biggest strength is going to be my ability to connect with
          people. I do like to be around other people and I do settle into new
          environments fairly quickly and do not have a problem introducing
          myself to new people and getting involved with them in whatever tasks
          are at hand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          My biggest limitations will probably be myself. I can self depreciate
          and second guess myself in terms of how much I understand or feel like
          I can contribute. This self doubt can then get onto of me and i build
          obstacles for myself that if I am honest probably do not exist and I
          can struggle to get round them so I will need to be aware of this and
          remind myself that it is my internal self sabotaging and not to let it
          hold me back.

        </h3>
        <p class="col">
          Finding time to stop, breath and be kind to myself. Linked to above I
          think I can let myself get carried away in the hype of the frantic
          nature of things and then let that overwhelm me to my detriment. I
          need to be more focused on being in the present, dealing with problems
          in small, almost bite-size pieces and then moving forward.

          What are my expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </h3>
        <p class="col">
          I have been really impressed with the foundations team and I have no
          doubt this support will continue. I suppose my biggest thing would be
          having facilitators in the team recognize when I am at a block and
          struggling to grapple with a concept and helping me to see ways to
          overcome it that I may be missing or maybe helping me re-phrase a
          concept so as to better understand it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          Basically just to recognize when the person may be in over their head
          and offer a hand at that time.

      <div class="col">
        <h3 class="col">What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p class="col">
          I need to take it up a level again - recognising when I am struggling
          early on and seeking to right the ship straight away. I also need to
          make sure that when something is not clicking with me I put in the
          extra time at home etc to make sure I crack it and can move with the
          cohort and not fall behind.

        In terms of my non-technical/human skills and what or how I would like

        change as well.

            imagine they are wide and varied. I would then like to use my new

              I would like to develop good strategies to deal with stress and

              environment.

            As I have alluded to in other areas on this blog I believe I am
            strong at following process and tend to pick up new ideas/systems
            relatively quickly. I also wok well with other people and enjoy that

            levels. This can at times lead to me feeling overwhelmed and
            thinking I am in over my head.

            Seeking help will involve two main things. Firstly trying to find
            solutions myself or as a group (if the task dictates group work) and
            if that is unsuccessful then approaching cohort mates of
            facilitators keeping in mind any deadlines and making sure it is not
            being left to the last minute.

          <p class="col">
            I would hope that they provide direction in a way that is not
            revealing the answer straight out but rather challenging me to
            recognise that I have knowledge and skills which are being added to
            and that I will in all likely hood be able to discover the answer
            myself.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            In saying the above I would also hope that facilitators would
            recognise when a particular problem may be outside my current
            wheelhouse and intervene if the need arises in a more direct fashion
            rather than suggestively.

            I find this aspect or question interesting as I have been lead to
            believe that once bootcamp starts it requires 100% focus from
            myself. If there is at all anyway I would be able to work in doing
            the pick ups of my daughter from kindy that would be wonderful as
            these are activities that are extremely important to me on many
            levels not least helping my partner. If it were to mean starting my
            days really early and doing extra work post dinner that would not be
            an issue for me and something I have done time and again with
            various jobs I have had so to be able to discuss and refine this
            more would be brilliant.
