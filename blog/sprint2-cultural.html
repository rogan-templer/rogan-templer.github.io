            My goal is to secure employment in the IT world as a web developer.
            In terms of the long term goal I want to use this course to help me
            understand the different pathways one can take in this role as I can
            imagine they are wide and varied. I would then like to use my new
            skills plus those life and work place skills I already have to help
            me on that pathway

            <p class="col">
              I would like to develop good strategies to deal with stress and
              workplace pressures. I feel that in past jobs I have had I have
              not done a very good job of taking care of My mental and inner
              well being. I would like to develop that skill set here as well as
              continue to work on relationship building within a workplace
              environment.

          <p class="col">
            As I have alluded to in other areas on this blog I believe I am
            strong at following process and tend to pick up new ideas/systems
            relatively quickly. I also wok well with other people and enjoy that
            type of interaction

          <p class="col">
            In terms of limitations I have what I would possibly describe as
            “imposter syndrome” at times where I doubt my own ability and skill
            levels. This can at times lead to me feeling overwhelmed and
            thinking I am in over my head.

            Most importantly will be understanding what is required on a weekly
            basis so as to be able to plan out how to approach the week and then
            deliver on any deadlines without impacting negatively on any other
            parties be they cohort members or facilitators

          <p class="col">
            Seeking help will involve two main things. Firstly trying to find
            solutions myself or as a group (if the task dictates group work) and
            if that is unsuccessful then approaching cohort mates of
            facilitators keeping in mind any deadlines and making sure it is not
            being left to the last minute.

          <p class="col">
            I would hope that they provide direction in a way that is not
            revealing the answer straight out but rather challenging me to
            recognise that I have knowledge and skills which are being added to
            and that I will in all likely hood be able to discover the answer
            myself.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="col">
            In saying the above I would also hope that facilitators would
            recognise when a particular problem may be outside my current
            wheelhouse and intervene if the need arises in a more direct fashion
            rather than suggestively.

            I find this aspect or question interesting as I have been lead to
            believe that once bootcamp starts it requires 100% focus from
            myself. If there is at all anyway I would be able to work in doing
            the pick ups of my daughter from kindy that would be wonderful as
            these are activities that are extremely important to me on many
            levels not least helping my partner. If it were to mean starting my
            days really early and doing extra work post dinner that would not be
            an issue for me and something I have done time and again with
            various jobs I have had so to be able to discuss and refine this
            more would be brilliant.
