          What three things have I learned about myself and my ego through the
          core learnings?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          I’ve learnt that I can identify when I am self sabotaging in the sense
          that I can see when my mind spirals and I can ‘get on top of myself’
          as-it-were and that this trough phase is as present, normal and
          transient as my peak phases.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          I have learnt ego wise that I do not have the answers and no matter
          how impatient I may be that i need to trust in process and pace myself
          according to me and my progress while not worrying about where I
          perceive other people around me to be in terms of progress along the
          journey - regardless of whether that perception is real or otherwise.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          I have learnt that I am capable and I need to keep reminding myself
          this - especially when things seem hopelessly difficult and that I
          feel that I am out of my depth.

          What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          I’m going to look at each trait individually and the role they play in
          the fields of learning and programming
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h3 class="col s-4">Values</h3>
        <p class="col">
          Values help set your course in terms of what you are accountable to,
          how you set your stall out and the base that you will approach your
          learning’s and your work from. In this case we are learning to
          programme and having a solid foundation in terms of ones mental
          approach is important.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h3 class="col s-4">Empathy</h3>
        <p class="col">
          I view this as probably the most important of the three traits.
          Empathy is so hugely important. In learning this means taking care of
          yourself, being aware that you are learning hard concepts and not to
          be over critical of yourself or hard on yourself. In the programming
          work space it means being attuned to those you are working with, how
          you may impact on them and also how external factors may be impacting
          them and to always keep it in mind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h3 class="col s-4">Self Awareness</h3>
        <p class="col">
          In learning this means being aware of your ebbs and flows - how you
          best learn, how you get the most from various learning forms and how
          to then leverage that moving forward. This flows on to programming as
          well as how you best learn can influence how you approach problems in
          the work environment and how best to set yourself up to bring the best
          out of yourself in an individual and team setting.

          What has surprised me the most about core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          The mindfulness part. It is something I have heard a lot about but
          never engaged with or only very superficially. Spending time in this
          space has really made the benefits apparent to me.
        </p>

      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h2 class="col s-4">
          What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          It goes hand in hand with the last question and that is the
          mindfulness part. It is something i need to lean into more heavily,
          however he challenging part for me at the moment is finding a regular
          time to engage with it every day - that is down to me and I know it is
          something I need to keep working at.
        </p>

      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h2 class="col s-4">
          Why do I think EDA focuses so much on core learning?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          It is pretty apparent why so much emphasis is placed on this. When you
          take time to examine these traits and characteristics they are the
          pillars of what helps build (in my opinion) better people. If you can
          make these a more conscious part of your life and daily routine you
          will be able to bring a more grounded, present and holistic version of
          yourself to whatever situation you approach and there is no downside
          to that as far as I can see.
        </p>

      <br />
      <div class="col">
        <h2 class="col s-4">
          Does the time spent on core feel like a waste? Should I have rather
          spent time practicing programming instead?
        </h2>
        <p class="col">
          To me, it would be foolish to view any of this as wasted time.
          Personally I have enjoyed this content as it has opened me up to new
          concepts, was of approaching life/work challenges and practices that I
          can see will only enhance my life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          While I concede that having a sound basis and knowledge of programming
          and the concepts involved with it is important I do believe that when
          you are engaging with a work place there is so much more to it than
          the technical skills. You will spend more time with work colleagues
          than your family so you need to be a good person and have empathy for
          your work mates as this will make for a much better work place.
