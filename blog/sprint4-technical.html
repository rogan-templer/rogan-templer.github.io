          Problem solving is something that will be at the core of pretty much
          everything we will do as web developers. With this in mind it is
          important to have a toolbox of problem solving techniques available to
          take with you into the fray.

        <h3 class="col s-4">A simple problem solved.</h3>
        <p class="col">
          So this week we had a number of coding tasks set out for us which were
          inevitably going to pose a number of challenges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          Early on we had a task of working with an object which was a persons
          called Terah and her object had a whole lot of details that related to
          her, such as her name, eye color, age etc. During the challenge we had
          to set Terahâ€™s spouse as Adam and then in return set his spouse value
          as Terah.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first part was simple enough but i found myself trip over when
          assigning Terah back to Adam as his spouse. I found I was trying to be
          to complex in my effort to find a solution so when I stopped took a
          breath and then tried the most simple/straight forward of solutuions
          it worked. My big take away was - when in doubt go with the most
          obvious as it usually is the most obvious for a reason.

        <h3 class="col s-4">An Elegant Solution.</h3>
        <p class="col">
          Another problem we needed to solve was a classical fizzbuzz problem.
          With this scenario you are asked to print out a list of numbers from 1
          -100 and you replace every multiple of 3 with the word fizz, multiples
          of 5 with the word buzz and multiples of 15 with fizzbuzz.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          Getting the problem solved initially I used a for loop that worked
          over a previously set up if statement that had been set up to ensure
          the correct results would be printed. There is an example of the code
          here;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          I was happy with my result but felt there could be a better way of
          solving this problem. After doing some research on the internet I
          found a video that laid out another way to solve the problem which
          would allow you to make changes to what numbers would be affected by
          the fizz buzz print out. It was a really cleaver way of approaching
          things and seemed pretty elegant to me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="col">
          The process also underlined to me the importance of using the internet
          as a tool to work through problems as there will be methods and
          solutions out there that you may not have thought of and it can be a
          valuable learning tool.
