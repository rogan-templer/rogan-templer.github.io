          Margin, Borders and Padding - what’s the fuss anyway? Glad you asked,
          there are a few distinct differences and understanding these will help
          see when and where you should be using each. Lets start off with a
          picture first:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <img
            src="../image/marginPadding.png"
            alt="Margin, Padding and Border Example Image"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          So what does this show us? Well basically the margin refers to the
          area around an element and the padding is the space between the
          element and the content inside the element. And they all get contained
          within a border. Great… so how does this affect us? Well essentially
          we can use this to create gaps between elements on our web pages -
          which is super important for making the presentation and look of your
          web page “just so” - as well as how our content either grows or
          shrinks in its specific spaces. So what are some practical examples of
          this? Let’s start off with padding. In the example below we have two
          boxes, green and blue, inside of a white box. Both of them are super
          skinny and the borders (the black outlines) are right up flush against
          the text as there is no padding present - see how the padding value in
          .green-box and .blue box is set to 0px
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col s-6">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <span class="first-pic"
            ><img src="../image/padding1.png" alt="Padding image"
          /></span>

          <img src="../image/padding2.png" alt="Padding code" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          Now if we increase the padding value to 20px in each we see the
          borders of those elements get pushed out by 20px both above and below
          the text giving the content more breathing room.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col s-6">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <span class="first-pic"
            ><img src="../image/padding3.png" alt="Padding image"
          /></span>

          <img src="../image/padding4.png" alt="Padding code" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          What about the Margin? We’ll use this value to affect the white space
          around our two coloured boxes. To start off we can see that the two
          boxes are evenly spaced from each other and in their relative
          positions to the outer border.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col s-6">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <img src="../image/margin1.png" alt="Margin Image" />
          <img src="../image/margin2.png" alt="Margin Code" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          If we change the margin value for the green box to 40px we should
          expect that box to decrease in size and the blue box to move further
          away from it. Note how the blue boxes margin of 10px has kept a
          smaller distance between its border and the outer border of the main
          box.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col s-6">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <img src="../image/margin3.png" alt="Margin Image" />
          <img src="../image/margin4.png" alt="Margin Code" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          Which leaves the border. Well like its name suggests it is what binds
          around the outside of a specific area containing an element as
          illustrated back in the first picture. You can control how thick it is
          and if you want it to have pointed or rounded edges. By adding in the
          line border-radius: 10px we have rounded out the border edges -
          choice!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col s-6">
        <div class="picture placement">
          <span class="first-pic"
            ><img src="../image/border3.png" alt="Border image"
          /></span>

          <img src="../image/border4.png" alt="Border Code" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          So in conclusion think of all of this as social distancing for your
          pages elements and content and the cool thing is you get to decide how
          draconian those social distancing rules need to be!
