              HTML & CSS - The differences between the two

              HTML and CSS are two different types of code that work together to
              produce a result, however in saying that they are quite different
              in their functions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="col">
              Let's imagine an artists canvas: They have their large blank
              canvas on which they can create the outline of the scene they wish
              to paint. That canvas and the outline are the HTML - they provide
              the structure and content of the picture, however on their own
              that is all they are.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="col">
              The CSS is the artists paint palette - this is how they bring the
              picture to life with colour and shading and turn the picture from
              a bare bones concept to its fullest expression.

              Control flow is the order in which code will be run in a programme
              or application. So the order the code is laid out in is very
              important as this is the order the application will follow - in
              terms of surfing you would first wax your board, put on your
              wetsuit, paddle out and then catch a wave - that is the order you
              would follow to achieve your surf session.

            <p class="col">
              Looping is when a function runs multiple times until it ends or is
              told to end. To stick with our surfing analogy a loop in this
              instance would be catch wave, paddle back to line up, catch wave,
              paddle back and so on until you finish your session.

              The DOM acts as an interface for HTML documents and allows other
              programming languages to connect to it and carry out functions.

              It breaks a page into different Nodes and these nodes allow
              programming languages (such as JavaScript) to connect to the page
              and affect the content of the page and how user interactions with
              the page are interpreted.

              You can interact with the DOM via the developer tools panel and

              First off it is important to understand the difference between
              Objects and arrays:

              <h3 class="col s-4">Objects</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="col">
              Objects allow you to store a number of different types of data
              under one umbrella such as this:
            </p>
            <br />
            <div class="col">
              <div class="picture placement">
                <img
                  src="../image/object.png"

            <p class="col">
              In this instance the object is the Artist and it contains a number
              of elements such as the artist name, album name and year released.
              To access the information in the Object you would use what is
              known as dot-notation to call on the parts of the object you wish
              to see.
            </p>

              <h3 class="col s-4">Arrays</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="col">
              Arrays hold a number of similar items such as a list of different
              surf boards as shown below:

            <br />
            <div class="col">

            <p class="col">
              Javascript stores this information in a zero based index - meaning
              that the items are in order from 0 upwards. So when a call such as
              the one below is made it will return ‘short board’ as the answer
              as ‘1’ is the second item in the list if we are counting from 0
              upwards.

              Functions in JavaScript allow you to run a defined piece of code
              numerous times. This is extremely useful if you are looking to
              repeat certain actions a number of times - for example if you
              wanted to run a temperature converter:
