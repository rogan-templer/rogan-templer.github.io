              A number of studies have started to show just how important EQ is
              in terms of a measure for success in all facets of life, both at
              home and in the work place.

              Think before reacting. In emotionally charged situations people
              with a higher EQ can step back and gain perspective over the
              situation without adding fuel to the fire which is vitally
              important.
